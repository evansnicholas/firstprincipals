Sizing is a thorny issue. The more we learn about clothes making, the more we are surprised that, given the narrow selection of sizing options available, anyone (especially if you are a woman) can find clothes that fit them at all. Or maybe we have forgotten what it actually means for clothing to fit properly, our awareness blunted by the mass produced garments that we all wear today.

Even worse than not fitting properly, sizing has become a judgement. The number quantifies the attractiveness of your body. Brands have become aware of this, and have started adjusting their sizes accordingly - this phenomenon is known as “vanity sizing”. In brand X you are an 8, making you feel slim and sleek, but in brand Y a 12, slow and podgy. The conclusion is clear - brand X suits you much better. For men the process might work the other way. In brand X you are an L - you feel broad shouldered and powerful - whereas in brand Y you might regress to an M.  

The problem is that sizing can never be expressed on a one dimensional scale, whether that be S - M - L .., or 8 - 10 - 12 … You might have a larger bust but a shorter upper body, or larger shoulders and a smaller bust. You might have smaller thighs and longer legs, a larger waist with straighter hips, or larger thighs and shorter legs. This multiplicity of dimensions objectively characterizes your body. They do not judge but should instead be carefully considered when finding the perfect fit. Whatever your body shape, you will look (and feel) better in clothes that fit.

At First Principals we want to take a different approach to sizing. We don’t want to design for the idealized figure, we want to ensure anyone can find a sizing option that works for them. However, we don’t want to overload you with complex sizing measurements and expect you to know exactly how large your _across front_, or _upper thigh_ is. So instead we will try working with personas. A persona is a real world person, whose measurements we have taken and for whom we have developed a tailor made size. Over time we hope to build up a representative number of personas such that you will always be able to find one that matches your own shape.   

This process will take time and we would love your help with it. If you cannot find a persona that matches you, please get in touch and we can develop a new persona based on your shape (and give you some freebies for your help). We are also interested in knowing what attributes of a persona you need to know in order to find the matching one: age, height, weight, bra size, (bust size? Waist size?) … 

If you have any other comments, questions or suggestions on sizing, please get in touch! This is a complex and fascinating subject, and we would love to hear from you.

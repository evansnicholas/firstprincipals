          A first principle is the most basic starting point from which all else
          follows. To derive a product from first principles means to understand
          every step of its creation, from cotton seed to shop window.

          In practice production chains extend over large swathes of space and
          time which makes it extremely difficult to grasp them completely, let
          alone control every step. Take something as simple as a white cotton
          t-shirt. The cotton must be grown from seed in a country with the
          correct climate. It must be harvested and processed into (coloured)
          fabric. It must be transported to a factory where it must be cut and
          sewn into a garment. It must be transported again to a shop or
          warehouse. And this is just the production of the physical good.
          Without design and marketing the t-shirt would remain without value,
          and potential wearers would remain unaware of its existence.

          Our solution is to gradually extend our control of the production
          process, starting with the final product and working back through the
          different stages. As our competences and resources grow we can bring
          more and more stages under our own control.

        <p className="f5-ns f6 lh-copy measure mt0-ns tj">
          Another aspect of the solution is to question the accepted first
          principles. Must we always make clothes from newly grown cotton-based
          textiles? Can we use recycled materials? Can we produce fabrics from
          other plants, or even other sources altogether?

          Why didn't we spell principle properly? It doesn't matter how
          sustainable your clothes are, they also have to look cool, they have
          to make you feel like you're the First Principal.

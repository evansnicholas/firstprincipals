      <p className="f5 lh-copy">
        Transparency is one of our core principles and we feel it is crucial to
        be totally clear about how we handle your data. Our business is making
        and selling clothing, not data. This means that we collect only the data
        we need to help us connect with our customers. We do not share this data
        with third parties and will not (ab)use it to spam you with excessive
        amounts of advertising. We will only communicate with you when we think
        we have something worth sharing. This privacy policy will explain how
        our organization uses the personal data we collect from you when you use
        our website.

      <h2>What data do we collect?</h2>
      <p className="f5 lh-copy">
        When you purchase one of our products we record your name and address in order to be able to ship
        your product to you. If you opt in for our newsletter we record your email address.  Our website 
        contains a Google Analytics script that gathers data about the usage of our site. The recorded usage
        patterns are anonymous. 
      </p>

      <h2>How do we collect your data?</h2>
      <p className="f5 lh-copy">
        You directly provide First Principals with most of the data we collect. We collect data and 
        process data when you:
          <ul>
            <li>Place an order</li>
            <li>Sign up for our newsletter</li>
          </ul>

        Our store is built using Big Cartel. When you browse our shop we gather anonymous data about
        how you use the store. Similar (anonymous) data is gathered by a Google Analytics script on our
        website.
      </p>

      <h2>How will we use your data?</h2>
      <p className="f5 lh-copy">
        First Principals collects your data so that we can:
          <ul>
            <li>Ship you your order</li>
            <li>Keep you up-to-date with our activities and new products.</li>
          </ul>
        
        We promise not to share your data with any third-parties (expect for the services we need to run
        our business, such as our store - see the next section for more detail). We also promise not to 
        spam you with inordinate amounts of marketing. We will only communicate with you when we believe 
        we have something interesting to share.
      </p>

      <h2>How do we store your data?</h2>
      <p className="f5 lh-copy">
        First Principals does not store any of your data itself. Instead we build our business on external
        services. These services are responsible for storing and protecting your data. We carefully 
        select the external services we choose to use to ensure they are reputable and can be trusted
        with your data. Data you provide when you place an order is stored by our e-commerce provider
        Big Cartel. When you sign up for our newsletter your data is saved by Mailchimp.
      </p>

      <h2>Marketing</h2>
      <p className="f5 lh-copy">
        First Principals would like to (occasionally) send you updates about our products.
        If you have agreed to receive marketing, you may always opt out at a later date.
        You have the right at any time to stop First Principals from contacting you for marketing purposes.
        If you no longer wish to be contacted for marketing purposes, you can unsubscribe from our newsletter
        using the link at the bottom of the email.
      </p>
